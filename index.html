        <li>Stumbles upon Seth operation with trucks filled with jewelry to send overseas</li>
        <li>After presenting herself, Seth brute forces the operation by sending off the jewelry filled trucks in a hurry.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Jade grapples onto one of the trucks as it zooms off, and so a chase begins</li>
                <li>When Jade is fighting inside the trucks, the thing that changes where the teleporter goes to, gets moved around.</li>
                <li>Right as Jade and the people she's fighting in the truck go through the first teleporter, which was initially supposed to go to the docks, goes to another district in the city.</li>
                <li>As the chase goes on, the truck plows through multiple of the different districts in the city, and Jade sees first hand just how different the city has become.</li>
                <li>The one truck she hijacks plows through multiple districts in a way that is not ignored by the city elites.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>So in the end, she successfully stops some of the operation, crashing one of the three trucks.</li>
        <li>The next day, she rushes over to Barry [the bounty bartender] to turn on the news</li>
        <li>Jade is absolutely ecstatic that she finally made an impact on the city, and with no major casualties.</li>
        <li>Seth on the other hand, was absolutely distraught. This is Seth's first time getting one of his operation plans ruined.</li>
        <li>Final scene takes you through the different crime bosses from their companies watching the news, some are shocked, some are smiling eagerly (as if to say it's begun), some are dead serious. </li>
        <li>Crime operations like this are supposed to stay under the radar. Jara Jewelry now had to make a statement explaining why they were transporting so much jewelry to the docks on an unsupervised road and all that.</li>
        <li>The final scene shows Claire for the first time looking dead serious from her office in the sky.</li>
    </ul>
